		<div>MORALITY</div>
		<div>Government Credibility in Enforcing the Law </div>
		<div>
In 2006, a shocking video was posted on the  Internet, in which a girl was crushing a kitten to death using her stilettos. The video was only a few minutes long, and the girl didn’t show her face. Since China’s legal system does not specify preventing animal cruelty, her behavior faced no punishment. But this certainly was not a satisfying answer for Chinese netizens. BrokenGlasses, a user on Mop, said that “I have no interest in spreading this video nor can I remain silent. I just hope justice can be done”, followed by thousands of response like “Find her and kick her to death like she did to the kitten”. They started a Human Flesh Search project on mob.com, calling to “hunt down the lady and cameraman” (Tsou, 184). This request soon appeared on lots of Chinese leading forums and raised national attention. More and more people devoted themselves to search for the girl’s real information. They identified the location by the backdrop of the video and got the user ID of the poster. Followed this clue, they found several records of purchasing of stilettos under the same ID name. Just six days after the video posted, the girl was identified as a nurse named Wang Yue in a local hospital in Hangzhou. Other information related to this girl was also made public including her phone number, address, and employer. Endless punishment came to her from the web. She received thousands of malicious phone call every day, some of them even contained death threats. Her life was affected a lot, she lost her job and left the city. 
Lacking a law preventing animal cruelty in China leads to some severe consequences. And Wang’s case was just the tip of the iceberg. Her video was originally posted on a website called Crushworld which contains videos of little animals crushed to death by attractive women, this website existed for a long time and sold those videos on disc for 15 yuan a pop. After this incident, this site was attacked and eventually shut down.
Though there are flaws in the legal system, the gap left by law sooner be filled with the moral standard as a way of regulating people’s behavior. To enforce the morality, a large group of people and detailed information of the target are necessary. The Human Flesh Search Engine, as an online crowdsourcing which involves multiple people to search and exchange information, fit perfectly in its role.
</div>
		<div>Country with a mature legal system</div>
		<div>Government as one of the executors of laws, their operation sometimes lack transparency in China. The illegal behavior can be hidden and hard to be punished. In the space where the law can’t reach, the moral norms, again, motivate people to take their actions. And not surprisingly, they chose to use the Human Flesh Search Engine.

		<div>Low coverage of the legal system.
</div>
		<div>Another case that shows the power of the Human Flesh Search Engine in pushing the law to be imposed is the case of Yang Dacai. Yang Dacai was the head of Shaanxi Province Work Safety Administration. He became a target of the Human Flesh Search Engine because he was captured of smiling at the scene of a road accident which killed 36 people. His smiling picture soon went virals among Chinese Internet. What he didn’t know at that point was that his inappropriate behavior had already made the Human Flesh  Search Engine target on him. His previous pictures were examined one by one. Netizens found he wore several designer watches and named him “watch brother”. He also had been found of wearing expensive belts and glasses in different occasions. Certainly, his salary can not afford those luxuries. The brands and types of those luxuries he owned were published online. In September 2013, he was accused of corruption, and those pictures served as important evidence on the court.</div>
		<div>In 2009, Li Qiaomin, who was jailed for illegal logging, was reported dead due to severe brain injury. The reason given by the local police was that he was playing hide and seek and accidentally hit his head on the wall. This explanation raised huge doubt among the Internet and became one of the most popular topics in that year. Online forums launched a Human Flesh Search Engine to reveal the truth. This constant attention from the web pushed the government to start an investigation. However, the later report from the investigation did not satisfy netizens. Through another Human Flesh Search, the real identities of members of the investigation team were exposed. Most of them are journalists and webmasters, and they were considered “insider” by netizens (Zhang, 2009). This raise even greater indignation among the Internet. Finally, the Yunnan Provincial Government admitted that Li was beaten by other prisoners, which caused his death. As a result, the vice-director of the local Public Security was dismissed, and two correctional officers were sent to jail.  
</div>
		<div>China’s case</div>
		<div>KefanXu</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Both those cases shared some similarities. People turned to the Human Flesh Search Engine because it was hard to make the government apologize for their deed nor put down a corruptive official. The illegal behavior in those cases was first detected by the Human Flesh Search instead of the legal system. The Human Flesh Search Engine takes the role of Procuratorate in investigating the truth and collecting evidence. But it works entirely different from the legal system. In Yang Daicai’s case and other cases of Human Flesh Search, which targeted on Government officials, such as Zhou Jiugeng (Yang, 2008), people who involved in the Human Flesh Search Engine usually don’t have any evidence of their crime. Their attention was first attracted by those inappropriate behaviors. Then Human Flesh Search targeted on those officials started from the moral perspective and used the legal system as the ultimate weapon.
Though China’s constitution gives every citizen the right of oversight, people usually face some difficulties when carrying out this right. The conflict between citizen’s political status and legal status, the government’s low transparency and the lack of channels to express people’s opinions (Yuan, 96) are reasons that cause people to feel hard to supervise the government to enforce the law. The government, which holds a huge power under a low level of public supervision, is under likely to pay attention to individual voices. However, this lack of interaction between citizens and the government also causes the government to rely more on the public opinion for potential feedbacks. The collaborative model that the Human Search Engine adapts allows people to act as one voice which is hard to be ignored. People are given more power in facing the government through the Human Search Engine. It allows people to form a collective entity which can communicate with the government directly in an equal status. Since it’s web-based, its influence can be spread to a large scale quite fast and even raise national attention, which motivates medias to follow up. All those things pressure the government to act according to people’s will, which, in this case, is to enforce the law. 
</div>
		<div>❻</div>
		<div>The legal system of China, especially the civil law, is far from mature. Its failing in covering some specific aspects leaves several grey zones. And varies types of misconducts can happen in those grey zones. While the law can do nothing with those things, it doesn’t mean people will tolerate them. At this point, the Human Flesh Search Engine serves as an effective tool for people to enforce their justice.  
</div>
		<div>How far its power can reach?
</div>
		<div>However, when things come to this point, we may ask that is this the ideal way in pushing the law forward? Should the legal system, which is designed to be judicial fair and rational, to reflect netizens’ opinion? If the power of netizens’ opinion is strong enough to change the law, why do we need the court and the entire legal system? And what might happen when we use netizens’ justice to replace the law?
</div>
		<div>But things did not end at this point. The Human Flesh Search Engine sometimes can even influence the law instead of just serve as a supplement. 
In this August, an incident occurred in Kunshan, in which a BMW collided with a bicycle when switching from the vehicle lane to the bicycle lane. Instead of apologizing, the drive of the BMW, Liu, got off his car and beat the biker, Yu. Then Liu returned to his car and went back to Yu with a knife in his hand. When he was hitting Yu using the knife, his knife slipped from his hand accidentally. Yu, the biker, quickly picked up the knife and fought back. All the thing happened that night was recorded by a surveillance camera. And Liu was reported dead the next day. Since China’s legal system has a vague  definition of the self-defense, cases like this will normally end up in excesses committed which can send Yu to the jail. But what’s different this time was that the video recorded by the surveillance camera went virals on Chinese Internet before any official investigation started. This video made a lot of  netizens stand on Yu’s side, they dig out all the information related to Liu’s background and found that Liu has several crime records. Some rumor appeared suggesting Liu involved in some gangster activities, which later proved to be wrong. A photo which showed Liu’s body fully covered with tattoo further enforced people’s assumption. Eventually, Yu was announced innocent on the court. And the Supreme People's Court later released a detailed document to clarify the self-defense.

		<div>What’s missing?</div>
		<div>The Human Flesh Search Engine:How Did the Justice be Imposed on People in China
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div> Though the law sometimes fails in China, it seems that justice always wins through the most effective tool hold by netizens, which is the Human Flesh Search Engine. But did we missed anything when cheering for the power of the Human Flesh Search Engine? 
Tom Downey call the Human Flesh Search Engine “a form of online vigilante justice”. Since sometimes there was no legal punishment on their target, those digital vigilantes usually practice their justice through lynching. 

After dropping a girl’s corgi from 6 floor’s window, He Xingli’s personal information was released online. Despite threatening messages, people even came to her home and burned fake paper money which usually used for the funeral  propose. Someone called her husband saying they can’t guarantee their daughters’ safety. And her door was painted with humiliating words. Users on Weibo said that those people who came to her did a good job and cheered for the effectiveness of morality when the law can’t take any action. </div>
		<div>The term Human Flesh Search Engine is the direct transformation from its Chinese term Renrousousuo (人肉搜索). It refers to a way of searching detailed and even private information about a particular person online through multiple users. The “Human Flesh” refers to the fact that the search is usually carried out by real people instead of any web search engines. As an online collaboration, it has the power of identifying a person through just a picture or a video. It can dig out the most secret information about the target and expose them to the public. Some media described it as a behavior carried out by “China's internet vigilantes” while some called it a “digital witch hunts”.</div>
		<div>Capone noticed that there is a similarity between the using of Human Search Engine and the Culture Revolution (Capone, 4) that “targets are attacked for their immoral behaviors and attributed to animals”. Both those two phenomena showed the power of the crowd in crushing any individuals to pieces. But different from the Culture Revolution where everyone was recognizable, you can’t tell the person behind the screen when involved in a Human Flesh Search.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>❶</div>
		<div>❸</div>
		<div>Imagine one day when you wake up and check your phone, an influx of messages comes to you. Most of them are meaningless and full of abusive words, then you notice some of them contain all your personal information (address, ID number, family member). You open the door and find there is an angry crowd of people gathered in your neighborhood aiming at you. All you can do at this point is staying in your room desperately. When this happened, you are likely to become a target of the Human Flesh Search Engine.</div>
		<div>LAW</div>
		<div>What’s going on?


</div>
		<div>❷</div>
		<div> Yin Feng’s life has been totally changed by the Human Flesh Search. Without knowing what happened, thousands of phone calls and text messages suddenly began to bombard him. Those messages contained obscene abuse, and some even threatened to burn his house if he refused to pay them 200, 000 RMB. Yin was accused of dolling down the window and spit on a homeless person on the street. Angry netizens dug out Yin’s license plate and claimed he was the driver. Yin insisted he was innocent, but that made no help. All his information including phone number, address and ID card number were released on the Internet. Endless phone calls and text messages totally ruined his private life. Netizens raised up as an entity, sharing their resource of the target in the Human Flesh Search Engine. But it lacks a rechecking system. Once the target is exposed, people usually can’t wait to enforce their justice instead of questioning whether the information is accurate. Once they are wrong, this huge entity suddenly disappears. It’s impossible for the victim to sue those people as a whole while it’s hard to trace every individual netizen. That’s to say, those digital vigilantes take no responsibility. 
</div>
		<div>The dual structure </div>
		<div>The Human Flesh Search Engine did not stop at this point. Started from China, it has become an international phenomenon. From 2001 to 2007 (Wang, 46), there are 35 Human Flesh Search incidents occurred, and 31 of them happened in China. Then, in 2008, 114 Human Flesh Search incidents were observed globally, 111 in China, one in the UK, one in France and one in the US.  
</div>
		<div>What’s the Human Flesh Search Engine?
</div>
		<div> Also, the “justice” is a vaguely defined word in the moral sphere. When people are carrying out their justice through the Human Flesh Search, they usually draw a clear line between good and evil. They believe they are the representative of justice and showed no mercy to the target. So Their punishment from the web can have different forms, from text harassment to real life attack. Netizens are competing with each other in carrying out crueller punishment. Those harassment cause huge pressure for the targeting person, aiming to make them “fired from their jobs,shamed in front of their neighbors, run out of town"Those punishments sometimes lead to serious results. On March 20 this year, a Weibo user said that she couldn’t afford the usury and planned to suicide. Her post attracted netizens’ attention, and she was rescued by Hainan Police. But later netizens found out she actually lived a wealthy life. They began to call her a performer who tried to attract people’s attention. 11 days after, she was found dead in a highway service station in Hunan. In this June, a man in Nanjing killed a Teddy dog for biting his son. Immediately, his family received thousands of messages contained cursing, which caused his wife to kill herself for “paying back the life of the dog”. 
In a digital age, everyone can become a target of the Human Flesh Engine. And it has the risk of being overused. This August, a doctor in the Deyang hospital was harassed by a boy in the swimming pool, her husband rebuked at that boy. The video recorded what happened was edited on purpose and posted on online by the father of that boy, titled with “Administrator of the City Water Bureau Beat Kids”. This video caused Human Flesh Search on this doctor and a massive cyberbullying. Faced a huge pressure, the doctor later suicided. Pan said that the Human Flesh Search Engine resembles a Panopticon which “gives its users homogenous power to observe and control others regardless of who these users are” (Pan 6). Since everyone is holding a phone with a camera, any behavior could be recorded, manipulated and became evidence of starting a Human Flesh Search. It raised question that it there truly the justice behind each case of the Human Flesh Search? The reason of starting the Human Flesh Search might just be a quarrel or a misunderstanding but pretend to be a chance for people to carry out their justice. 
The Human Flesh Search Engine has enormous power, but this power is unlimited and unsupervised. And who hold this power are netizens who live in a space far from the reality. People carry out the Human Flesh Search based on the presumption that the target is guilty. Innocent people can be a victim just because manipulated pictures or videos. Netizens don’t care about the truth, they care about sending out their anger, they care about how their power be enforced on people, they care about themselves. Sometimes it is just a tyranny of the majority.

</div>
		<div>❹</div>
		<div>❽</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Why is China so significant in the data? Li Gao (Gao, 128) attributed this to the Chinese culture which contains a belief that “good society will develop through the upholding of morality and strict standards based on objective and generally-accepted norms”. She pointed out that there is a dual structure of social governance in China, one is the legal system, and another one is the moral code. Since the law is unable to cover every aspect of the social life, the rest of the social behaviors are governed by the norms. In other words, the moral norms always try to fill in the gap between the law. If a legal system is too weak in imposing its power or has certain limits,  people are likely to use moral norms to carry out their justice. That’s to say, the legal system and political structure of China play a role in the prevalence of human flesh search. Through the Human Flesh Search Engine, molarity norms and laws interact in a unique way in China and keep shaping Chinese society.
</div>
		<div>Why China?</div>
		<div>What’s next?</div>
		<div> It’s impossible for the legal system to cover every aspect of people’s life. The space, where the law doesn’t specify, is so-called grey zones. Though things happened in those space won’t face legal punishment, but that doesn’t mean some behavior will be tolerated. The morality quickly fills in this gap. Different from the legal system, it doesn’t specify the executor so anyone can carry out their punishment to the target. In the old days, things like animal cruelty or cheating occupied a little space in the newspaper and TV. When entering the web 2.0, the Internet became an effective tool in organizing people and sharing information. People started to gather automatically on the web to scrutinize behaviors that violate the moral norms. Their searching towards a person who violated the moral norms can go virals on the Internet and attract more people to participate in the search. The Internet also provides them with convenience in passing through evidence, analyzing people’s background, tracing target and punishing them. In this way, they formed a moral court which holds enormous power with little responsibility to take.
The emergence of the Human Flesh Search Engine in China has multiple reasons. The low coverage of the law leaves some grey zone, and the government’s lack of transparency and unwillingness in enforcing the law leaves some immoral behavior away from punishment. So people who can’t tolerate those behaviors turn to the web and use the Human Flesh Search Engine to enforce their justice based on their moral standard. It’s effective in some ways. The animal cruelty, malpractice, and corruption are punished through this collective power. It prevents society from degenerating when the law has little to do. In some case, it does not only replace the function of the law but can even change the law. However, the power of the Human Search Engine is rough and chaotic and sometimes might lose control. When enforcing their justice through the Human Search Engine, people replace the vague definition of justice with their own moral standard. Those digital vigilantes hunt their target with no mercy. The lynching in the 21 century, such as abusive message, threaten phone calls, are used as weapons of those digital vigilantes. And those vigilantes won’t follow any laws, as well as moral norms when executing their justice. They are treating violence with another kind of violence which is the cyberbullying. Once became a target of the Human Search Engine, one’s life will be totally ruined since all the personal information will be exposed online, which means that the button of punishing have been distributed to every netizen so everyone on the Internet can choose to press that button to punish the target at any time with no cost. Even if the Engine mistakes the target, this huge monster will just disappear into every single righteous netizen no matter how severe the consequence can be. 
The power of the Human Search Engine needs to be limited. And it’s dangerous to let the moral norm occupy a large space of the social life since it’s vaguely defined and can form a panopticon where everyone is surveilling on everyone. 
From the side of the law and government, first, the flaws in the law need to be amended to avoid grey zones. Second, the government should improve their efficiency in reacting to social events. Third, the government’s action in enforcing the law should be transparent and impartial and ensure citizens’ right to know. Lastly, citizens should be given more channels to express their opinions and greater power in supervising the government. Those actions help the government restore their credibility and bring the law back to its original place to serve as the legal tool of enforcing justice in the society. Once people feel the law and the government is reliable, they will be less likely to use the Human Flesh Search Engine as an extreme way to solve the problem. The Human Flesh Search Engine also needs to be regularized. People should be aware that the power of the Human Flesh Search Engine might be overused. Netizens’ behavior which violates other’s privacy needs to be stopped. Illegal behaviors involved in the Human Flesh Search, such as tailing after the target and sending threatening messages, need to face legal punishment. Netizens should be encouraged to report their problems via regulated channels when holding the evidence instead of calling others to carry out lynching. 
From the case of the Human Flesh Search Engine, we can see that both the law and morality play an important role in regularizing society. The morality can fill the gap left by law. However, it’s dangerous to let morality dominate society. This requires the law to be continuously improved to reflect citizens’ pursuit of justice. In other words, the morality should act as a lubricant to make the society better and the law should act as the oil to motivate the society forward.
